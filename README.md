# NNScratch
In this project a multiple hidden layer Neural Network is used. Helper functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that fragments the code and eases the process of building a neural network are also implemented.
Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.
This model is now used for the cat - non-cat classifier and it gives an accuracy of 82% which is significantly better than the 2 layer model.
